# The Daily Life Crisis

This blogsite is part of a capstone project in Dr. Angela Yu's web dev bootcamp.

As of now this site will have all the basic CRUD operations which a blog should have and i will add more features later on as i progress further in the bootcamp and expand my knowledge on other topics.

The tech stack for this project is:-

1. EJS for templating
2. CSS for styling
3. HTML5 for the structure of the site
4. Express.js for the server
5. Node.js as the runtime env.
6. Javascript as the programming language
