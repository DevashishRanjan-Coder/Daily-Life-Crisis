# The Daily Life Crisis

This blogsite is part of a capstone project in Dr. Angela Yu's web dev bootcamp.

As of now this site will have all the basic CRUD operations which a blog should have and i will more features later on as i progress further in the bootcamp and expand my knowledge on other topics.

The tech stack for this project is:-
EJS for templating
CSS for styling
HTML5 for the structure of the site
Express.js for the server
Node.js as the runtime env.
Javascript as the programming language
